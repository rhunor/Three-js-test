Project Description
This basic project shows a rotating cube in the browser using Three.js.

The main logic for creating the scene and rendering the cube is located in src/index.js. The createScene function creates the scene and adds the necessary components, such as the camera and the cube. The animate function handles the rendering loop and updates the cube's rotation.

The utils.js file contains a helper function for creating a cube geometry.
